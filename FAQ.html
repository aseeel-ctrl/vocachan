                      <p>vchan is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can
                      post comments and share images. vchan's collaborative-community format
                      was inspired by one of the most popular forums in Japan, Futaba Channel.
                      Different boards are dedicated to different topics, from Japanese anime,
                      manga, and culture to videogames, music, and photography. Users do not
                      need to register an account before participating in the community.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p>In order to access the full site, you must first read and
                      agree to the terms of the disclaimer. To access the disclaimer
                      simply click any board and a dialogue will appear. Your response will be
                      cookied so you'll only need to do this once (providing you don't clear your
                      cache/cookies afterwards). If you wish to browse the site using frames, visit

                      result in post deletion, a temporary ban, or in some cases,
                      permanent banishment. <em>Understand the rules before you begin

                    <dd>
<p>In order to post on vchan you have to do <u><b>one</b></u> of the following:<ul>
<li>If you are a new user of vchan (i.e., have never posted before), simply wait for 15 minutes before attempting to post. Click &#039;Get Captcha&#039; then wait for the timer to count down. Consider browsing the board in another tab while you wait.</li>
<li><a href="https://sys.vchan.org/signin">Verify your email address</a> to be able to post immediately.</li>
<li>Have a <a href="https://www.vchan.org/pass">vchan Pass</a>.</li>
</ul>
So for clarity, you do not have to verify your email address if you don&#039;t want to. If you are a new user, you can instead simply wait 15 minutes before posting. Lurk a thread, browse the site, or just come back later. After the wait, you can post threads and replies as normal. Verifying your email address merely bypasses the wait. It will also make your experience smoother by allowing you to bypass various other filters and blocks.<br>
<br>
You will need to accept vchan cookies for any of these methods to work. Please ensure that your browser is not set to block cookies, or that you whitelist vchan domains in any browser extensions you use which may block cookies. Should you choose to verify your email to bypass the wait, we will not retain long-term records of your email address. After the verification email has been sent, your email address will be purged from our servers.</p>

                    <dt id="trip">How do I use a "tripcode"?</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>Tripcodes can help verify a user's identity to others, and are a
                      type of <em>pseudo</em>-registration. To use a normal tripcode,
                      place a hash mark ("#") followed by a word or short phrase after
                      what you've entered into the [Name] field (ex. "User#password").
                      Upon submission, the server will generate the hash unique to that
                      particular word or phrase. The previous example would display
                      "<span style="color:#000080"><strong>User</strong>
                      !ozOtJW9BFA</span>" after being posted.</p><br />
                      <p><strong>Important note:</strong> A tripcode is generated only
                      using the text entered after the hash mark. Your entered name, IP
                      address, cookie information, etc. do not affect the output. Normal
                      tripcodes are <em>not</em> secure, and can be cracked with relative ease.
                      For a more secure solution, see <a href="#sectrip">secure
                      tripcodes</a>.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p>A <em>secure</em> tripcode can be generated by placing two
                      hash marks in the [Name] field, as opposed to one as with a
                      <em>normal</em> tripcode (ex. "User##password"). Secure tripcodes
                      use a secret key file on the server to help obscure their password.
                      The previous example would display "<span
                      style="color:#000080"><strong>User</strong> !!rEkSWzi2+mz</span>"

                      <p>A capcode is a way of verifying someone as a vchan team member.
                      Normal users do not have the ability to post using a capcode. A <a
                      href="#whomod">moderator</a> capcode will display "<span
                      style="color:#800080"><strong>## Mod
                      <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/modicon.gif" alt="Mod Icon" title="This user is a vchan Moderator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;" /></strong></span>"
                      after their name. Similarly, the <a href="#whoadmin">administrator</a> capcode
                      displays "<span style="color:#FF0000"><strong>## Admin <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/adminicon.gif" alt="Admin Icon" title="This user is the vchan Administrator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;" /></strong></span>".
                      Often times, a moderator will post as
                      "<span style="color:#800080"><strong>Anonymous ##
                      Mod <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/modicon.gif" alt="Mod Icon" title="This user is a vchan Moderator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;" /></strong></span>" in order to keep their identity secret (which
                      is policy). <a href="#whojan">Janitors</a> do not receive a

                      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Icons will always appear alongside a capcode, and will display a tooltip that says "This user is a/the vchan Moderator/Administrator" upon mousing over them. If there is no icon/tooltip, the poster is
                      an impersonator.</p>

                      lefthand corner of the specific post(s) you wish to remove, and
                      scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the [Delete]

                      <p>Threads expire and are pruned by vchan's software at a
                      relatively high rate. Since most boards are limited to ten
                      pages, content is usually available for only a few hours or days before
                      it is removed. Most times, the post was probably pruned automatically, however in some cases it
                      may have been removed by a moderator or janitor.
                      We ask that users refrain from reposting material that they believe
                      to have been deleted by the moderators.</p>

                      along with the uploading of quality images and files. We feel that
                      positive contribution should be treated as a way of donating to

                    <dd>
                      <p>Moderators are individuals selected to perform general site
                      maintenance. They may delete posts globally, ban users, sticky and
                      close threads, etc. There is no publicly available list of
                      moderators. Since vchan is primarily an <em>anonymous</em>
                      website, the moderators abide by that same mindset.</p>

                    <dt id="whojan">What are "janitors"?</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>"Janitors" are a class between "end user" and "moderator." They
                      are given access to the report system and may delete posts on their
                      assigned board(s), as well as submit ban requests. Janitors are
                      selected via an application, orientation, and testing process.
                      Janitors are instructed to not reveal their position to others and
                      are to conduct themselves as would be expected of any other user. A
                      breach in confidentiality is grounds for immediate expulsion from
                      the program.</p>

                    <dt id="moderation">I never see proof of moderation! Why?</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>...Why would you? There is no public record of deletion, and
                      since threads are frequently pruned, there is no way of knowing
                      which have been removed by the moderation team. The "<span
                      style="color:red"><strong>(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS
                      POST)</strong></span>" message is optional and only used under
                      certain circumstances, so it's not a good indication of how
                      frequently users are being banned. Usually when a user is banned,
                      their posts are removed because they're in violation of the rules!
                      Quite simply, <em>there is no way for an end user to accurately
                      judge the amount of moderation taking place at any given point in
                      time</em>. Rest assured though; the moderators and janitors are
                      always working hard to do their best and keep the boards free of
                      rule breaking content.</p>

                      <em>Period</em>. The janitor program is occasionally opened up to
                      new applicants. Watch the global message and blotter for notices
                      concerning the application process. If there is no advertised

                      affected by a ban meant for somebody else, contact a moderator on IRC at

                      sub-forum of The Something Awful Forums. The site began as a small

                      garnered enough traffic and popularity to become its own fully
